## Thrive Peer Health Educator
<i>April 2019 - June 2020</i>
<br>
<br>When entering college, I found myself nervous about the stories of peer pressure surrounding alcohol; the prevalance of sexual assault on college campuses; and how busy students across campus seemed to be, with expectations to take heavy class loads in addition to being involved across campus. I quickly learned the need to find balance and empower myself in making the choices best for me–something that comes easy in some ways and continues to be challenging in others. In finding this balance and empowerment for myself, I wanted to support other students in doing the same, leading me to the Thrive Peer Health Educator team.
<br>
<br>The Thrive Peer Health Educator team is a group of undergraduate students seeking to empower the DU community to make informed choices regarding alcohol and other drugs, sexual health, and mental health. In this role, I positively impacted the DU community through sharing knowledge and resources and starting conversations around traditionally stigmatized issues in an effort to normalize them. While doing this, I developed and expanded my own knowledge around these topics; obtained skills related to educating, facilitating, event planning, and program development; and observed and experienced people-first management.
<br>
<br>While my time as a Thrive Peer Health Educator was relatively short, it made a significant impact on me, and I carry forward many lessons and skills, in addition to my continued passion for the topics. In my later role as the TA Coordinator for the Microsoft Certification Program, I brought members of this team to discuss mental health with my new team, recoginizing the widespread importance of the topic. Further, observing the people-first management style and the resulting success I experienced as a team member influenced my leadership style, as I strive to build connection within teams and to see those I interact with as human first. By caring for each other as humans first, I believe we will have more to offer and deliver in our various capacities.

        <b>Weekly Tabling:</b> I facilitated outreach events in residence halls to raise awareness surrounding alcohol and drugs, sexual health, and mental health. This outreach included engaging students through trivia and other activities, serving as a quick and fun interaction to start a conversation surrounding these important and prevalent topics. While we facilitated numerous activities, the drink pouring activity is my favorite. Using water, participants pour a standard drink of beer, wine, and liquor to their best estimate; then, we measure it. This promotes safe drinking strategies, inclduing pouring and counting drinks accurately.
        <br><br><blockquote>My experiences with this outreach helped me develop skills in engaging and educating my peers. Our first challenge was in getting passersby to approach our table and engage in the activity. In doing this, I learned tricks for catching others' attention and engaging them, often through humor and relatability. The next challenge was relaying information in an effictive way and navigating contradictory opinions. I found rooting my knowledge in the facual information I was trained, directing to resources, and being open to conversation and questions to be helpful. I recognize I always have more to learn, and approaching with that mindset and curiousity helped build bridges across differing opinions and experiences.</blockquote>

        <b>Moments of Mindfulness:</b> I hosted weekly destress events–Moments of Mindfulness–in the residence halls, creating an opportunity and space to decompress and focus on mental well-being. These events included making friendship bracelets and coloring, in addition to having peer educators available to engage in conversation and offer resources as appropriate.
        <br><br><blockquote>While these events created a valuable mindfulness space for students, they also taught me the importance of creating space for yourself to decompress. Each week, I was reminded how refreshing it can be to take an hour to reset. This is a lesson I seek to carry forward for myself and for others in my leadership roles.

        <b>Mental Health Workshop Facilitation:</b> I led a "Success, Not Stress" workshop for a campus sorority, helping students better understand stress and how to manage it. This included learning what stress is, how it can be helpful and harmful, positive and negative coping mechanisms, how to manage stress in the long-term, and how to identify when it is more than "just stress."
        <br><br><blockquote>Seeing how stress can be positive is one of my favorite elements of this presentation. What if we think about stress as something to help us meet a challenge and succeed, rather than something to avoid? <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend?language=en" target="_blank">This TED Talk</a> by Kelly McGonigal talks about the benefit of making stress your friend, which is something I strive to adapt in my own mindset.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Faciliating this workshop helped me develop skills in guided questioning. Rather than dictating the information, it is most effective when participants engage, brainstorm, and come to ideas on their own. A key component of this presentation is asking participants questions to guide them to the talking points, allowing the material to better resonate.</blockquote>

        <b>Thriving on Your 21st Birthday Program:</b> When turning 21, individuals often participate in drinking activities and face new challenges, whether drinking for the first time, drinking in new or unfamiliar environments, or feeling pressured to drink more than they are comfortable. The 21st Birthday Initiative is a partnership with local businesses to promote safe drinking practices while celebrating one's 21st birthday. The week of their 21st birthday, participants receive a coupon book and information session, providing resources for a safer and more enjoyable celebration. The coupons include free and reduced-price food from local restaurants, as eating while using substances is a harm reduction strategy and offers an alternative to using substances.
        <br><br><blockquote> I was on the committee adapting this program for our campus, including brainstoriming ideas, developing materials, and establishing relationships with community partners. Unfortunately, I was no longer serving in the peer educator role once the program launched. Nonetheless, the program is successful, and the opportunity helped me develop important skills, including developing community relations, garnering support for a project and issue I am passionate about, and managing a long-term project (using a Trello board I created and trained our team on).

        <b>Free STI Testing Events:</b> To promote sexual health on campus, the Health Promotion team at the Health and Counseling Center hosts community partners to provide free STI testing. At these events, I checked-in community members and offered information and resources. Additionally, I collected the information voluntarily provided by participating community members and reported it using visualizations, allowing us to better understand who attended the event, how they heard about it, and what additional programming is wanted. This then allowed our team to make improvements for future events.
        <br><br><blockquote>At these events, I developed skills in creating a welcoming, safe, and non-judgemental environment. Due to the stigma associated with sexual health, this can be an uncomfortable experience for many, and I strived to meet others at their comfort level, ensuring they felt safe.</blockquote>
