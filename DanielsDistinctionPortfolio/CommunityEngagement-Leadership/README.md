<br>
<br>When entering college, I found myself nervous about the stories of peer pressure surrounding alcohol; the prevalance of sexual assault on college campuses; and how busy students across campus seemed to be, with expectations to take heavy class loads in addition to being involved across campus. I quickly learned the need to find balance and empower myself in making the choices best for meâ€“something that comes easy in some ways and continues to be challenging in others. In finding this balance and empowerment for myself, I wanted to support other students in doing the same, leading me to the Thrive Peer Health Educator team.
<br>
<br>The Thrive Peer Health Educator team is a group of undergraduate students seeking to empower the DU community to make informed choices regarding alcohol and other drugs, sexual health, and mental health.

        <b>Weekly tabling:</b> I hosted outreach events in residence halls to raise awareness surrounding alcohol and drugs, sexual health, and mental health. This outreach included engaging students through trivia and other activities, serving as a quick and fun interaction to start a conversation surrounding these important and prevalent topics.
        <br><br><i>The drink pouring activity is my favorite. Using water, participants pour a standard drink of beer, wine, and liquor to their best estimate; then, we measure it. This promotes safe drinking strategies, inclduing pouring and counting drinks accurately.</i>
