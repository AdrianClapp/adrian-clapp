<br>
<br>When entering college, I found myself nervous about the stories of peer pressure surrounding alcohol; the prevalance of sexual assault on college campuses; and how busy students across campus seemed to be, with expectations to take heavy class loads in addition to being involved across campus. I quickly learned the need to find balance and empower myself in making the choices best for meâ€“something that comes easy in some ways and continues to be challenging in others. In finding this balance and empowerment for myself, I wanted to support other students in doing the same, leading me to the Thrive Peer Health Educator team.
<br>
<br>The Thrive Peer Health Educator team is a group of undergraduate students seeking to empower the DU community to make informed choices regarding alcohol and other drugs, sexual health, and mental health. Some activities and events I facilitated in working toward this goal are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Weekly tabling: Hosted outreach events in residence halls, including trivia and activities, to raise awareness surrounding alcohol and drugs, sexual health, and mental health</li>
  <li>Moments of Mindfulness: </>
  <li>Mental health workshop facilitation: Led a "Success, Not Stress" workshop to help students better understand stress and how to manage it</li>
  <li>Free STI testing events: </li>
  <li>
  <li>Developed presentations:</li>
