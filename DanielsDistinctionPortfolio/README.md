### Thrive Peer Health Educator
<i>April 2019 - June 2020</i>
<br>
<br>When entering college, I found myself nervous about the stories of peer pressure surrounding alcohol; the prevalance of sexual assault on college campuses; and how busy students across campus seemed to be, with expectations to take heavy class loads in addition to being involved across campus. I quickly learned the need to find balance and empower myself in making the choices best for me–something that comes easy in some ways and continues to be challenging in others. In finding this balance and empowerment for myself, I wanted to support other students in doing the same, leading me to the Thrive Peer Health Educator team.
<br>
<br>The Thrive Peer Health Educator team is a group of undergraduate students seeking to empower the DU community to make informed choices regarding alcohol and other drugs, sexual health, and mental health. In this role, I positively impacted the DU community through sharing knowledge and resources and starting conversations around traditionally stigmatized issues in an effort to normalize them. While doing this, I developed and expanded my own knowledge around these topics; obtained skills related to educating, facilitating, event planning, and program development; and observed and experienced people-first management.
<br>
<br>While my time as a Thrive Peer Health Educator was relatively short, it made a significant impact on me, and I carry forward many lessons and skills, in addition to my continued passion for the topics. In my later role as the TA Coordinator for the Microsoft Certification Program, I brought members of this team to discuss mental health with my new team, recoginizing the widespread importance of the topic. Further, observing the people-first management style and the resulting success I experienced as a team member influenced my leadership style, as I strive to build connection within teams and to see those I interact with as human first. By caring for each other as humans first, I believe we will have more to offer and deliver in our various capacities.

        <b>Weekly Tabling:</b> I facilitated outreach events in residence halls to raise awareness surrounding alcohol and drugs, sexual health, and mental health. This outreach included engaging students through trivia and other activities, serving as a quick and fun interaction to start a conversation surrounding these important and prevalent topics. While we facilitated numerous activities, the drink pouring activity is my favorite. Using water, participants pour a standard drink of beer, wine, and liquor to their best estimate; then, we measure it. This promotes safe drinking strategies, inclduing pouring and counting drinks accurately.
        <br><br><blockquote>My experiences with this outreach helped me develop skills in engaging and educating my peers. Our first challenge was in getting passersby to approach our table and engage in the activity. In doing this, I learned tricks for catching others' attention and engaging them, often through humor and relatability. The next challenge was relaying information in an effictive way and navigating contradictory opinions. I found rooting my knowledge in the facual information I was trained, directing to resources, and being open to conversation and questions to be helpful. I recognize I always have more to learn, and approaching with that mindset and curiousity helped build bridges across differing opinions and experiences.</blockquote>

        <b>Moments of Mindfulness:</b> I hosted weekly destress events–Moments of Mindfulness–in the residence halls, creating an opportunity and space to decompress and focus on mental well-being. These events included making friendship bracelets and coloring, in addition to having peer educators available to engage in conversation and offer resources as appropriate.
        <br><br><blockquote>While these events created a valuable mindfulness space for students, they also taught me the importance of creating space for yourself to decompress. Each week, I was reminded how refreshing it can be to take an hour to reset. This is a lesson I seek to carry forward for myself and for others in my leadership roles.

        <b>Mental Health Workshop Facilitation:</b> I led a "Success, Not Stress" workshop for a campus sorority, helping students better understand stress and how to manage it. This included learning what stress is, how it can be helpful and harmful, positive and negative coping mechanisms, how to manage stress in the long-term, and how to identify when it is more than "just stress."
        <br><br><blockquote>Seeing how stress can be positive is one of my favorite elements of this presentation. What if we think about stress as something to help us meet a challenge and succeed, rather than something to avoid? <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend?language=en" target="_blank">This TED Talk</a> by Kelly McGonigal talks about the benefit of making stress your friend, which is something I strive to adapt in my own mindset.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Faciliating this workshop helped me develop skills in guided questioning. Rather than dictating the information, it is most effective when participants engage, brainstorm, and come to ideas on their own. A key component of this presentation is asking participants questions to guide them to the talking points, allowing the material to better resonate.</blockquote>

        <b>Thriving on Your 21st Birthday Program:</b> When turning 21, individuals often participate in drinking activities and face new challenges, whether drinking for the first time, drinking in new or unfamiliar environments, or feeling pressured to drink more than they are comfortable. The 21st Birthday Initiative is a partnership with local businesses to promote safe drinking practices while celebrating one's 21st birthday. The week of their 21st birthday, participants receive a coupon book and information session, providing resources for a safer and more enjoyable celebration. The coupons include free and reduced-price food from local restaurants, as eating while using substances is a harm reduction strategy and offers an alternative to using substances.
        <br><br><blockquote> I was on the committee adapting this program for our campus, including brainstoriming ideas, developing materials, and establishing relationships with community partners. Unfortunately, I was no longer serving in the peer educator role once the program launched. Nonetheless, the program is successful, and the opportunity helped me develop important skills, including developing community relations, garnering support for a project and issue I am passionate about, and managing a long-term project (using a Trello board I created and trained our team on).

        <b>Free STI Testing Events:</b> To promote sexual health on campus, the Health Promotion team at the Health and Counseling Center hosts community partners to provide free STI testing. At these events, I checked-in community members and offered information and resources. Additionally, I collected the information voluntarily provided by participating community members and reported it using visualizations, allowing us to better understand who attended the event, how they heard about it, and what additional programming is wanted. This then allowed our team to make improvements for future events.
        <br><br><blockquote>At these events, I developed skills in creating a welcoming, safe, and non-judgemental environment. Due to the stigma associated with sexual health, this can be an uncomfortable experience for many, and I strived to meet others at their comfort level, ensuring they felt safe.</blockquote>

### Human Leadership Program
<i>August 2021</i>
<br>
<br>The book <i>Permission to Screw Up: How I Learned to Lead by Doing (Almost) Everything Wrong</i> by Kristen Hadeed was my favorite read in college, although not for a class. In this book, Kristen told her story, beginning with her experiences starting and growing her business in college and including the valuable lessons she learned along the way. Her story particularly resonated with me because she was a college student managing college students, like I am doing in college. While reading, I connected with many of her experiences and appreciated her perspective. This book inspired me in many ways, and when the opportunity to attend her Human Leadership Program arose, I registered in hopes of continuing to learn and challenge myself as a leader.
<br>
<br>At Kristen Hadeed's <a href="https://www.kristenhadeed.com/humanleadershipprogram" target="_blank">Human Leadership Program</a>, we covered thinkning, trusting, communicating, growing, caring, and inspiring like a leader. These conversations included our personal narratives and how they impact our mindset and behavior; vulnerability in the workplace and our ability to build, maintain, and strengthen trust; our ability to give, receive, and solicit feedback; our resillience and ability to face fear, failure, challeges, and uncertainty; our ability to take care of ourselves so we can serve others; and our ability to take ownership and make an impact. Throughout the program, I learned about myself, identified areas I need to improve, and gained valuable tools and perspective in how to be a leader that empowers others. I regularly refer to what I learned in these two days while intentionally understanding and guiding my interactions with others. Not only have I implemented my takeaways from these two days in my own leadership, I have brought the conversations I found most impactful back to my Microsoft Certification TA team, adapting workshops on feedback and personal narratives to facilitate conversation and development surrounding these important topics. Leadership is an area we can always grow and improve, and the Human Leadership Program taught me to lead with love as my most authentic, human self–something I strive to do every day.

  <br>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Think Like a Leader:</b> How life experiences shape mindset and behavior, and how to harness elements of mindset that fuel forward, while reframing those that hold back.
        <br><br><blockquote>In reflecting on the most challenging personal relationships in my life and by identifying my personal narratives, I recognized "it is my job to make you happy" as the personal narrative with the biggest impact on my life. I am a peacekeeper, and this stems from my experiences growing up. This personal narrative has many positive impacts: I care deeply about others, do what I can to help others, and consider others when making decisions. However, it also has negative impacts: Always seeking to please others can result in an unsustainable amount of work toward an often impossible goal (always making everyone happy), creating an immense and exhausting weight. While I appreciate the positives of this personal narrative and continue to harness them, I recognize the need to set boundaries and prioritize my wellbeing. To support others to the best of my ability, I also need to take care of myself. Thus, I seek to reframe this limiting belief: It is my hope to make others happy by being kind, although it is not my job. While I better recognize this tendency now, it continues to be a challenge.</blockquote>
        <blockquote><b>Key takeaway:</b> Everyone has their own limiting beliefs impacting their mindset and behaviors. How can we help each other recognize and face our limiting beliefs?</blockquote>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Trust Like a Leader:</b> How to build, maintain, and strengthen trust in relationships, in addition to the role of vulnerability at work.
        <br><br><blockquote>I believe vulnerability belongs in the workplace because we are all human and being vulnerable allows us to see each other as such. While there is a line for oversharing, vulnerability creates a genuine environment for teams and normalizes asking for help, creating a stronger and more empowered team. How do we make people feel seen and heard? Truly listen and reflectively respond. How can we ask questions in a way that promotes vulnerability and connection? In our relationships, we have emotional bank accounts that grow with deposits and shrink with withdrawls. How can we build balances to stregthen our relationships and trust?</blockquote>
        <blockquote><b>Key takeaway:</b> I strongly value the ideas and experiences of others. However, I often face two challenges: (1) Setting aside distractions to truly listen and (2) giving up control in trusting others. When listening to others, my attention may wander to the tasks floating in my head, and when working with others, I struggle to trust and transfer ownership. The following help me face these challenges: (1) I schdeule time for myself to be mentally present and then intentionally clear my mind at that time, and (2) I weigh the value of the work being completed by me versus the value of trusting and empowering another.</blockquote>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>Communicate Like a Leader:</b> How to give, receive, and solicit feedback in using communication to build connection and trust.
        <br><br><blockquote>Giving feedback is challenging, and a positive versus negative experience impacts the relationship, one developing trust and the other breaking it, respectively. There are two forms of feedback: Growth feedback inspiring change and recognition feedback inspiring repetition. The most valuable feedback highlights the feeling, behavior, and impact, and we can take several actions to better give, receive, and solicit feedback for optimal experience and development.</blockquote>
        <blockquote><b>Key takeaway:</b> People give feedback because they care, and that is now my perspective when both giving and receiving feedback. Since this session, I have intentionally impemented key steps in my feedback interactions. In receiving feedback, I start with "thank you" then "tell me more" to develop trust and fully understand the feedback. In giving feedback, I strive to follow the FBI model, sharing the feeling, behavior, and impact.</blockquote>

        <b>Grow Like a Leader:</b> How to grow resilience and ability to face fear, failure, and setbacks.
        <br><br><blockquote>Although easier said than done, I believe failing is acceptable, given you learn from it. A healthy relationship with failure enables you to take risks and try new things, and resiliency is how we move through challenges, learn, and bounce back with passion and curiousity. What about success? I define success as being proud of myself and happy with the outcome, although others may define it differently. Like failure, there can be a fear in success. With success comes responsibility and a pressure to both maintain and improve upon that success. In building a "resilience resume," I reflected on challenging situations, what I learned from them, and how I grew, allowing me to recoginize my capability and adaptability.</blockquote>
        <blockquote><b>Key takeaways:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Approach fear with curiosity, exploring and planning what to do in various scenarios.</li> 
            <li>Take first step with permission to do it bad: If you do nothing, cannot make it better–do something then make it better.</li>
            <li>In uncertainty, find certainty: Identify and focus efforts on what can be controlled.</li>
            <li>Empower others in overcoming challenges: Say "tell me more..." to help people find the answers they already have; ask others three ideas to approach a challenge and the recommendation; ask questions rather than give solutions.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Slow down to speed up: Take time and give others the opportunity to try something new–train them.</li>
              <li>Plus one others' ideas sparingly: Does it really need the improvement? Ask a question instead.</li>
              <li>Talk less, listen more.</li>
