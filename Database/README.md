# Back to Roots Bakery OLTP

### Executive Summary
Back to Roots Bakery is a health-conscious, community-centered bakery focused on helping people feel their best while still enjoying “going for ice cream.” The bakery makes and sells a variety of treats and comfort foods for in-store ordering, pre-ordered pick-up, and delivery. Orders can be placed using a variety of methods, including in-store, by phone, and online. In 2018, Back to Roots Bakery opened their first location in Boulder, Colorado and recently opened a new location in Longmont, Colorado. With this expansion, the bakery has seen an increase in demand. This proposed database will give Back to Roots Bakery the competitive advantage, customer insights, process optimization, and data-driven decision-making capabilities to compete in an increasingly competitive industry and to maximize their potential.

### The Problem and Opportunity
Back to Roots Bakery decided a database is necessary for several key reasons, including creating a competitive advantage and better meeting customer needs:
<ul>
  <li>A rise in the quantity of customers, employees, and orders following the opening of a new store location and the increased interest in health-conscious eating.</li>
  <li>The need to ensure optimal employee contribution and success in managing customer orders.</li>
  <li>The need to understand customer purchasing patterns–including what they are purchasing, when they are purchasing it, where they are purchasing it, and how they are purchasing it–to better meet customer demands and facilitate growth accordingly.</li>
  <li>The need to reduce inventory costs by purchasing inventory and producing products that align with customer demands.</li>
  <li>The need to compete in an increasingly competitive market of health conscious-eating, particularly in the Boulder area.</li>
  </li>The need to improve customer experience to facilitate customer satisfaction and loyalty.</li>
 </ul>
After seeing an increase in health-conscious eating and the success of the Boulder store location, Back to Roots Bakery expanded, opening a new location in Longmont, Colorado to meet this rising demand. With this, Back to Roots Bakery hired more employees and is seeing an increase in both customers and orders. Due to this growth, a database has become necessary to collect valuable data and facilitate its conversion into meaningful information from which data-driven decisions can be made. This database will provide access to valuable information, help analyze customer purchasing habits, improve employee productivity and success, aid in reducing costs, facilitate process optimization, and ultimately lead to improved performance and customer satisfaction through better decision making.
<br>
<br>With the increasing interest in health-conscious eating, particularly in the Boulder area, Back to Roots Bakery is facing more competition, meaning they must differentiate themselves with a competitive advantage. Despite the high initial cost, investment in this database will help provide that competitive advantage and be worthwhile in the long run. Ultimately, this database will guide Back to Roots Bakery’s competitive advantage through its enablement of improved decision-making leading to efficiency, customer satisfaction, and the automation of processes.
